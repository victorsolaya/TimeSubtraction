## Time Subtraction

The Time Subtraction project allows you to input two distinct times and then subtract them to get the difference between them, in minutes.

If you want to, you can add more inputs and calculate more than two distinct times at once. 

Any contributions to this project will be helpful, especially creating a CSS stylesheet and improving the functionality of the website.

Thank you for reading this, have a nice day!

# Examples
Let's say you want to calculate the the time between <b>1:31</b> and <b>2:41</b>:

You then insert those numbers on the website, click subtract time and you'll get <b>1:10</b>, 
meaning there is one hour and ten minutes difference. 

There is also an option to calculate the total, by pressing "Get total", which in this case would return <b>4:12</b>.
