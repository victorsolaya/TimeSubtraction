##Time Subtraction

#This is the README.md file for the TimeSubtraction project made by me.

Follow me on GitHub: https://www.github.com/victorsolaya

The Time Subtraction project allows you to input two distinct times and then subtract them to get the difference between them, in minutes.
Any contributions to this project will be helpful, especially creating a CSS stylesheet and improving the functionality of the website.

Thank you for reading this! Have a nice day!
